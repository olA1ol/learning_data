On a full charge you get 2 days of use and thats with me heavily using it. I recommend getting the 128 gb version of this tablet given its a tremendous value. If you are use to using a laptop or a PC this tablet comes equipped with Samsung Dex which gives you that same look and feel so that's a big plus. Overall it's a really good tablet for the price that comes with a lot of bells and whistles you see with a expensive tablet. I highly recommend!\""
